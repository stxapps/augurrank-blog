Prediction games are interactive experiences in which participants make forecasts about future events. They can range from simple polls to complex simulations and often incorporate gamification elements to encourage participation and engagement.

## What is a Prediction Game?

A prediction game is an activity or contest where participants forecast future events, often competing for points, rewards, or simply bragging rights based on their predictions' accuracy. These games typically involve guessing outcomes in various fields, such as sports, politics, finance, or entertainment, to earn recognition or prizes through superior accuracy.

The concept of prediction games can range from simple guessing contests (like "predicting the final score of a football game") to more sophisticated setups involving rules and scoring systems that reward correct guesses and penalize incorrect ones.

## How do prediction games work?

- **Polls:** The most basic form of prediction game, in which participants choose from a set of options.
- **Ranking:** Participants rank potential outcomes in order of likelihood.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Participants predict numerical values such as stock prices or temperature over time.
- **Scenario Planning:** Participants create and evaluate different future scenarios.

## Prediction Games vs. Prediction Markets

Prediction games and prediction markets share a common focus on forecasting future events. However, they differ in structure, purpose, and how participants engage. Here are some critical comparisons:

### Nature of Participation

Prediction Games are played for fun, competition, or rewards. Participation can be based on intuition, skill, or analysis, with scoring typically rewarding accuracy. No real money necessarily needs to be at stake.

Prediction Markets function more like financial markets, where participants "buy" and "sell" shares of outcomes. The value of these shares reflects the probability of a particular event happening, as perceived by the collective participants. These markets involve real or virtual money and encourage participants to support their predictions with their resources.

### Purpose and Motivation

Prediction Games are primarily aimed at entertainment, education, or fostering engagement (e.g., an office sports pool or an app-based trivia challenge).

Prediction Markets are geared toward aggregating diverse opinions to arrive at the most accurate collective forecast possible. They are often used for research or decision-making. Examples include political election prediction platforms like PredictIt or markets used within companies to forecast product launches.

### Mechanics and Influence

Prediction Games usually have fixed outcomes that are unaffected by user participation. Participants win or lose based purely on the accuracy of their guesses, often according to predetermined rules.

Prediction Markets' prices and probabilities fluctuate as people "trade" based on their beliefs. These markets often incorporate dynamic user inputs, and participants can influence each other through their transactions.

## Examples of Prediction Games

- **Fantasy Sports Leagues:** Players select teams or make guesses about sports outcomes to earn points based on actual game results. For example, predicting which football team will win each week of the season.
- **App-based Games:** In-app games may challenge users to guess various world outcomes (e.g., pop culture questions or geopolitical developments).
- **Community Contests:** Simple guessing games, such as who will win an election or the next box office hit.

## Examples of Prediction Markets

- **PredictIt:** A prediction market focused on political outcomes, where users buy shares in the outcome of political events.
- **Kalshi:** A regulated prediction market where people trade on various real-world events, from economic indicators to weather outcomes.
- **Augur:** A decentralized prediction market protocol based on blockchain technology where participants can create and bet on event outcomes in a decentralized manner.

## Benefits of Prediction Games

- **Entertainment:** Many prediction games are played for fun, with the thrill of guessing correctly as a significant motivator. The chance to win, earn recognition, or beat friends and colleagues fuels participation.
- **Collective Intelligence:** Harnessing the crowd's wisdom to make more accurate forecasts.
- **Skill Testing:** Games can allow users to showcase expertise or learn new things by analyzing trends and outcomes.

Prediction games are a form of forecasting competition â€” one more fascinating way to interact with the unknown. They offer fun, thrills, bragging rights, and wisdom of the future for making informed decisions.
