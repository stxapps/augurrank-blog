Challenge yourself and prove you were right forever. Have you ever called the next big thing, only to have your friends scoff and say, "Yeah, well, anyone could say that after it happens"? We've all been there.

Introducing a prediction game that lets you challenge yourself to envision the future, store your predictions on the chain, and brag about your accuracy forever.

## Here's the Problem and How We Solve It

We've all had those moments when we confidently make amazing predictions, only for them to completely vanish when it's time to show off. There's no concrete proof you were right about that skyrocketing BTC price or the surprise meme NFT outcome.

AugurRank fixes that with the power of blockchain technology. We store your predictions on the secure and transparent Stacks blockchain, making them permanent and verifiable.

## How it Works

1. **Predict the future:** Choose an event, such as the future price of Bitcoin, and envision its outcome.
2. **Put Your Vision on Chain:** Store your prediction on the Stacks blockchain, creating a permanent record.
3. **The future Arrives:** AugurRank verifies the outcome, possibly in a decentralized way, such as with AMM pools for crypto prices.
4. **See How You Stack Up:** Track your accuracy against others and climb the AugurRank leaderboard.
5. **Brag About Your Brilliance:** Earn bragging rights and prove your vision to the world.

## AugurRank is More Than Just Predictions; it's:

- **Permanent:** Your vision will live on the blockchain for eternity.
- **Verifiable:** Everything is on-chain, ensuring fairness and trust.
- **Community-driven:** No central authority controls your data or predictions.
- **Fun:** Push yourself to the top of the leaderboard. Engage in friendly competition and test your future-seeing skills.
