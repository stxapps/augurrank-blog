We're thrilled to announce two new features that bring our Web3 vision closer: BNS usernames and Stacks NFT avatars! You can now select one of your BNS names as your username and one of your Stacks NFTs as your avatar on your profile page.

We're building a game where players can own their identity and data. We're putting you in control by integrating Bitcoin Name System (BNS) and Stacks NFTs.

- **Own Your Identity:** Say goodbye to generic usernames! Now, you can represent yourself in the game using your BNS name. This is your unique identifier on the Stacks blockchain. Instantly recognizable and undeniably yours.
- **Express Yourself with NFTs:** Tired of the same old profile picture? Show off your Stacks NFT collection! Select one of your prized NFTs to serve as your avatar in the game. Let your personality shine and flex your digital assets while you climb the leaderboard.

These new features aren't just cosmetic. They're a testament to our commitment to Web3 principles. Remember, this game is built on blockchain:

- **Predictions on Chain:** Every prediction you make is recorded on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. No more hidden data or questionable results.
- **Smart Contract Verified Outcomes:** The outcomes of each prediction are calculated by a smart contract. This means fairness is guaranteed. No human intervention, just the logic of the blockchain.

Our game should be more than just entertainment. It should be a platform for building a reputation, earning bragging rights, and experiencing the true potential of Web3. By leveraging the power of Stacks, we're creating a transparent, secure, and decentralized game.

Go to the game now and connect your Stacks wallet to choose your BNS username and NFT avatar. Start making predictions, climb the ranks, and build your reputation in a truly Web3 environment.
